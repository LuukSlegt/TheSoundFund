    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>You choose the tracks</strong> — you decide what to offer (only existing songs).</li>
      <li><strong>We make you an offer</strong> — based on your streaming history.</li>
      <li><strong>You get paid upfront</strong> — no loans, no repayment.</li>
      <li><strong>You keep earning</strong> — you retain your share of all future royalties.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>About The SoundFund</h2>
    <p>The SoundFund was founded by Luuk Slegt to solve a simple but urgent problem in the music world: Independent artists were creating valuable work — but had no access to capital unless they gave up ownership, control, or both.</p>
    <p>We exist to change that.</p>
    <p>The SoundFund gives artists upfront funding by investing in the master rights to tracks that are already streaming. No pressure to recoup. No control over future work. Just fair, transparent support — built to help great music fund itself, sustainably and independently.</p>
    <p>Our mission goes beyond just making deals — we’re here to rebalance the power between creators and capital, and to prove that fairness can scale.</p>
